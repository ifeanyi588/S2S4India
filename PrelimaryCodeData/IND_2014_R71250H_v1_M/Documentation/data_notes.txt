Some notes from reading the documentation and dealing with the data

- Due to the change in coverage and difference in concepts and definitions in respect of
some important parameters followed in the two rounds, the results of NSS 71st round are not
strictly comparable with the results of NSS 60th round. While making any comparison, these
differences may be taken into consideration.

- The sampling seems like they survey 8 households on each block. The FSU are census villages in
the rural areas and Urban Frame Survey (UFS) blocks in the Urban areas. Large FSUs are broken up
into smaller groups or blocks. The ultimate sampling unit is the household. An equal number of 
households are picked up in each block. Its a stratified multi-stage sample which in this case 
means the districts form the number of strata. The substrata size is equal to the number of 
households in each block. 

- Household's usual consumer expenditure in a month: Households usual consumer expenditure is the
sum total of monetary values of all goods and services usually consumed (out of purchase or procured
otherwise) by the household on domestic account during a month. This has the following components
which are given below: 
A. usual expenditure for household purposes in a month
B. Purchase value of any household durables (mobile phones, TV sets, fridge, fans, cooler, AC, 
vehicles, computers, furniture, kitchen equipment, etc) purchased during the last one year and
the expenditure per month obtained by dividing by 12. 
C. if any household consumption (usually) from (a) wages in kind (b) home-grown stock (c) free 
collection was there, then the approximate monthly value of the amount usually consumed in a 
month was imputed
